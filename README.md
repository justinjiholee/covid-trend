# COVID-19 Vaccinations Trend

## Background
The Covid-19 has impacted every aspect of people’s livelihood around the world. This pandemic has led to new cases and deaths every day for over an year. While this is a global pandemic, the number of cases and deaths differ for every country. In our previous project, we have decided to measure total cases, new cases, and total deaths in select countries to find a trend for the pandemic as well as to find an association with the government policies using Stringency Index.

This time, as many people around the world are getting vaccinated, we wanted to look at trends of people getting vaccinated for different countries. From the stakeholder’s point of view, we wanted to think about how the vaccinations should be distributed based on the trends. As Johns Hopkins provides vaccinations, we have decided to look at vaccination trends for five countries with the most international students at Hopkins and analyze how to distribute the vaccines. 
 
## Business Question
  _How should Hopkins think about getting students vaccinated?_
  
## Data Analysis
Extracting the data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations), we were able to analyze the current trends of vaccinations. Using groupby tool on python, we were able to look at the number of total cases and total vaccinations for the selected five countires.

From this table, it is shown that China and India had the most amount of vaccinations, but they also have a significantly high population, so we decided to look at total vaccinations per hundred in order to compare the percent of people getting vaccinated from their countries. 

## Data Visualization

In order to compare the percent of people getting vaccinated for different countries, we have first decided to make a bar graph using plotly as it provides effective comparison.

From this graph, we learned that Canada has the highest proportion of people who got vaccinated, followed by Turkey, China, India, and South Korea. In addition to the bar chart of the percentage of people who got vaccinated, we have also created a line graph of vaccination trends using scatter tool.
